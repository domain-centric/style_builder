Welcome to [style_builder](https://pub.dev/packages/style_builder), the code generator for Flutter style (ThemeExtension) classes. 
The code generator helps to:
* minimize the required boilerplate code (without ugly part statements)
* define cosmetic default values, that could be derived from the BuildContext (e.g. from the current theme)
* resolve cosmetic values as intended by the flutter team
